# Edgebetweenness
Edge betweenness for social media

Modelling social as graphs from data mining aspect itâ€™s called link mining. The link itself is often concern to us as information. For instance, in certain circumstances, not all links are observed thus we possibly interested in predicting the existence of link between instances.  Nodes of graph represented as group of friends or communities, and edges as information. The project aim is to measure distance between communities using dataset from LinkedIn using one of clustering algorithms which is Betweenness algorithm to find communities in social network. This measurement helps us to know for instance if we want to o publish advert how far it will propagate between LinkedIn communities.

The project implemented using R and Java. 


# Page Ranking 

Recommend movie web page based on user personal sessions induced from web server, then drive adjacency matrix. The adjacency matrix act as input for PageRank algorithms (which is widely used in google search engine). The movie web page recommendation sets arranged according to values of PageRank score.
